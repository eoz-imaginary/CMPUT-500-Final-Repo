# CMPUT 500 Final Project Repo

This repo contains the reports from the experiments run with Proverbot9001. 

To view the individual report for a given project, navigate into [project-name]-report and open the file titled "report.html." 

To recreate these results, clone Proverbot9001 from https://github.com/UCSD-PL/proverbot9001, and download one of the following packages from https://coq.inria.fr/opam/www/: rsa, group-theory, higman-cf, or angles. For the best chance of a successful reproduction, please run on Ubuntu 20.04. 

The "Patched Errors" folder documents each error found in the Proverbot9001 artifact that was ultimately patched.
